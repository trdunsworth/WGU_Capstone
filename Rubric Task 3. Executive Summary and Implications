A.  Executive Summary and Implications
Develop an executive summary using your data and results from task 2. The summary should be written for an audience of your data-analytics peers or members of your team and should include each of the following:
•  a statement of the problem and the hypothesis
•  a summary of the data-analysis process
•  an outline of the findings
•  an explanation of the limitations of the techniques and tools used
•  a summary of proposed actions
•  expected benefits of the study (be as specific and quantitative as possible)

B.  Presentation of Findings
1.  Present your executive summary from part A to an audience of nonpractitioners. Use Panopto to record yourself delivering a presentation that includes slides displayed by a multimedia tool (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi). Your recording should capture both you and your multimedia presentation. Your presentation should also demonstrate appropriate communication skills for the audience.
2.  Your presentation should cover each of the following points:
•  a brief introduction of yourself and your background
•  a statement of the problem and the hypothesis
•  a summary of the data-analysis process
•  an outline of the findings
•  an explanation of the limitations of the techniques and tools used
•  a summary of proposed actions
•  expected benefits of the study (be as specific and quantitative as possible)

C.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
